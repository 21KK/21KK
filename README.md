# üí´ About Me:
## Hi, Kiran Kumar here as 21KK!üëã
Data Specialist | Entrepreneur | Consultant

**Focused on delivering data-driven solutions through analytics, business intelligence, and process optimization.<br>
This GitHub profile showcases the culmination of years of hands-on experience and diverse projects I‚Äôve worked on. Additionally, you can visit my [website](https://www.k21projects.in) (under construction) to explore a variety of works, including:**

*- Blogs discussing how critical analytics decisions were made.*<br>
*- Case studies on key business improvements driven by data insights.*<br>
*- Backtesting quantitative strategies to optimize trading systems.*<br>
*- Predictive modeling using various regression techniques and time-series forecasting methods. These include advanced methods like ARMA, ARIMA, GARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH, and GARCH to analyze and forecast financial market behaviors.*<br>

**These topics are crucial for understanding the dynamics of financial markets and offer a deep dive into the applications of statistical models in finance.**

### üå±  What I‚Äôm Learning!?
**I‚Äôm continuously exploring new tools and methodologies in data science, particularly in AI/ML applications and advanced statistical modeling.
I am also working on re-creating a Six Sigma Black Belt Project which I have worked on, although the time of completing the project is not decided yet, but will keep posted.**
